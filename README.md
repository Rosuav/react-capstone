# React with Spotify

Sample test/playground application built around React and Redux libraries.

# What is being used

- [react](https://github.com/facebook/react):
- [react-redux](https://github.com/rackt/react-redux)
- [react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router)
- [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)
- [react-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom)

# Idea

Practice the use and structure of React/Redux application; in addition to discover and practice other module and libraries that have been integrated.
I see the app as a good reference point to develop in the future.

### UP & RUNNING
* `npm install`
* `npm start`
* visit `http://localhost:8080/`
